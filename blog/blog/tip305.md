### How to automatically manage Azure Blob Storage lifecycle

#### Azure Blob Storage access tiers
In [Azure Blob Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-overview?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev), you pay for the storage that blobs take up and the tier that they are stored in. For instance, blobs that are stored in the [Hot tier](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-storage-tiers?tabs=azure-portal#hot-access-tier&WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) are the most expensive and can be accessed directly. And blobs in the [Archive tier](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-storage-tiers?tabs=azure-portal#archive-access-tier&WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) are the least expensive and take a while to be accessed. This tiered system is great and works well when you actively move your blobs to the appropriate tiers. [Azure Blob Storage lifecycle management](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-lifecycle-management-concepts?tabs=azure-portal&WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) makes this easier by automatically moving blobs or deleting them based on rules.

In this post, we'll configure an Azure Blob Storage lifecycle management rule in the Azure portal. 


#### Prerequisites
If you want to follow along, you'll need the following:
* An Azure subscription (If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) before you begin)
* A General Purpose v2 [Azure Storage Account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create?tabs=azure-portal&WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev)

#### Create a Blob Lifecycle management rule
Let's create a rule for Azure Blobs to move to the Cool storage access tier when they aren't modified for 20 days.

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-azureappsdev)
2. Navigate to the Azure Storage account
3. In the **Blob service** section of the menu, select **Lifecycle management**

(Lifecycle management menu in the Azure portal)

4. Create a new rule by clicking on the **Add rule** button
5. In the **Details** tab:
    1. Put in a **name** for the rule
    2. Select **Limit blobs with filters**
    3. Select **Base blobs** for **Blob subtype**
    4. Select **Next**

<img :src="$withBase('/files/89rule1.png')">

(Create a Lifecycle rule, details tab in the Azure portal)

6. On the **Base blobs** tab:
    1. Put **"20"** in the **More than (days ago)** field
    2. Select **Move to cool storage**
    3. Select **Next**

<img :src="$withBase('/files/89rule2.png')">

(Create a Lifecycle rule, base blobs tab in the Azure portal)

7. In the **Filter set** tab, put in **\logs** to indicate that this rule only applies to the "logs" container

<img :src="$withBase('/files/89rule3.png')">

(Create a Lifecycle rule, filter set tab in the Azure portal)

8. Select **Add** to create the rule

Now, all blobs in the logs container that aren't modified for 20 days, will automatically be moved to cool storage.

#### Conclusion
[Azure Blob Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-overview?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) [access tiers](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-storage-tiers?tabs=azure-portal&WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) are great to reduce your storage costs. And now, with [Azure Blob Storage lifecycle management](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-lifecycle-management-concepts?tabs=azure-portal&WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev), you can automatically move blobs to their appropriate access tier, based on their usage. Go and check it out!
