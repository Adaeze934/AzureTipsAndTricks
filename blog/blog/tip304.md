### How to use the VS Code Logic Apps extension to create stateless workflows

#### Orchestrate workflows with Azure Logic Apps
[Azure Logic Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-overview?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) provide the central integration solution for your applications and services. Logic Apps enable you to create workflow orchestrations that are triggered by events like a timer or a new message on a queue and can call [various APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/connectors/apis-list?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) in sequence or in parallel to accomplish tasks. Logic Apps run your workflows serverless, without managing infrastructure. 

Azure Logic Apps can pass information from one step to subsequent steps. For instance, if one step in a Logic App receives JSON data from an API, you can use that data in a next step to create a file with. This **"dynamic content"** is retained by Azure Logic Apps. In [**stateful**](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/logic-apps/create-stateful-stateless-workflows-visual-studio-code#stateful-versus-stateless-logic-apps?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) Logic Apps, this data is retained in external storage, which makes it easy to re-run the workflow and restart it if it is interrupted by downtime. You can also create a **stateless** Logic App. A stateless app retains its dynamic content only in memory, which makes it faster and less expensive to run, although it won't be able to restart its workflow after an interruption. 

In this post, we'll create and run a stateless Azure Logic App, locally, with VS Code. 

#### Prerequisites
If you want to follow along, you'll need the following:
* An Azure subscription (If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) before you begin)
* [Azure Storage Emulator 5.10](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=717179?WT.mc_id=microsoft-azuredevtips-azureappsdev)
  * To run the emulator, you need to have a local SQL DB installation, such as the free [SQL Server 2019 Express Edition](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=866658?WT.mc_id=microsoft-azuredevtips-azureappsdev)
  * Before you open the Logic App Designer in VS Code, run the Azure Storage Emulator
* The [latest version of VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download?WT.mc_id=other-azuredevtips-azureappsdev)
  * The VS Code [Azure Account extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.azure-account)
  * The VS Code [C# for Visual Studio Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.csharp)
* [Azure Functions Core Tools](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-core-tools/releases/tag/3.0.2931?WT.mc_id=github-azuredevtips-azureappsde) (v3 or higher)
* [.NET Core SDK 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1?WT.mc_id=microsoft-azuredevtips-azureappsdev)
* An Azure Storage Account with a Storage Queue. Learn how to create one [in this quickstart](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/queues/storage-quickstart-queues-portal?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev)

#### Create a stateless Logic App workflow with VS Code
Let's create a new Azure Logic App from VS Code.

1. Open **VS Code**
2. Go to the **Extensions** menu
3. To create stateless Logic Apps, we need the newest Azure Logic Apps Extension. Search for **Logic Apps** and install the [newest Logic Apps extension](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2143167?WT.mc_id=microsoft-azuredevtips-azureappsdev)

(Newest Azure Logic Apps extension for VS Code)

4. When the extension is installed, select the **Azure** menu in VS Code
    1. You'll see a section for Logic Apps. Sign into Azure if it asks you to
5. In the Logic Apps section, click **Create New Project**
6. Select a **folder** to store the new Logic App project in 
7. Select **Stateless workflow**
8. Type in a **name** for the workflow and press **Enter**
9. Choose to open the project in the **current window** to open the Logic App project

10. In the Logic App code, you'll see a file called **workflow.json**. Right-click on the file and select **Open in Designer**
11. When asked, choose **Use connectors from Azure**
12. Also, select a **Resource Group in Azure** to store new resources in
13. In the workflow designer, select the trigger **"When a HTTP request is received"**. This will trigger the workflow when a HTTP request is received on a certain URL
14. Next, click on **New step**
15. In the **Add and action tab** on the right, select the **Azure tab**
16. Search for **"queue"** and select **Azure Queues**
17. Next, select the action **"Put a message on a queue"**
18. Now we need to create a connection to Azure Storage. Select the **Azure Storage account** that contains the queue that you want to use
18. In the next screen, select the **name** of the Azure Storage Queue that you want to send a message to
19. Select the **Message** input box. This makes the **dynamic content window** appear. Click on **See more** in the dynamic content window to see all the data fields that you can use from the previous step. Select **Queries**, to fill the message with whatever is in the querystring of the request that triggers the workflow

(Dynamic content window)

20. That's it! Click **Save** to save the workflow. You'll see that saving creates a connections.json file which contains the connection information for Azure Storage
21. Let's test the workflow by pressing **F5** in VS Code. This will start the workflow on the local Azure Functions Runtime and will expose an HTTP endpoint for it that we can call to trigger it
22. When the workflow is running, **right-click on the workflow.json** file and select **Overview**. This will show the trigger URL to call. Copy the complete URL

<img :src="$withBase('/files/88overview.png')">

(Overview tab with HTTP trigger URL)

23. Open a browser and paste in the URL and append it with **&thistextwillbequeued**
24. Check the Azure Storage Queue. This should have a new message in it with the text **thistextwillbequeued**, which is what we appended as a querystring to the HTTP request that triggered the workflow

<img :src="$withBase('/files/88result.png')">

#### Conclusion
[Azure Logic Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-overview?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) is great for easily creating comprehensive workflows. It is made even easier with the [VS Code extension for Azure Logic Apps](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2143167?WT.mc_id=microsoft-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) and is made faster and less expensive by using [stateless workflows](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/logic-apps/create-stateful-stateless-workflows-visual-studio-code#stateful-versus-stateless-logic-apps?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev).
