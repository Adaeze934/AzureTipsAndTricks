### How to debug and run code locally with Bridge to Kubernetes for VS Code

#### Troubleshoot complex container solutions
You can use containers to run complex solutions that consist of multiple services, like an HTTP server, a database and a cache. To manage these containers, you can use Kubernetes as an orchestrator. In Azure, you would use [Azure Kubernetes Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/intro-kubernetes?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) for this. Troubleshooting applications in such a complex solution seems difficult, but [Bridge to Kubernetes](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/bridge/overview-bridge-to-kubernetes?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) can help. Bridge to Kubernetes allows you to run and debug code on your development computer for an application that runs in your Kubernetes cluster.

In this post, we'll use [Bridge to Kubernetes](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/bridge/overview-bridge-to-kubernetes?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com?WT.mc_id=other-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) to debug a sample application that runs in [Azure Kubernetes Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/intro-kubernetes?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev).

#### Prerequisites
If you want to follow along, you'll need the following:
* An Azure subscription (If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) before you begin)
* The [latest version of VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download?WT.mc_id=other-azuredevtips-azureappsdev)
* An existing Azure Kubernetes Service cluster with a sample application running in it. You can follow [this tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/kubernetes-walkthrough?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) to set it up
* The latest version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/?WT.mc_id=other-azuredevtips-azureappsdev). You'll need this to debug the [sample application](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-voting-app-redis?WT.mc_id=github-azuredevtips-azureappsdev)

#### Use Bridge to Kubernetes
This tutorial assumes that you have an Azure Kubernetes Service that is running the [sample voting application](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/kubernetes-walkthrough?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev). This application has a frontend and backend, and you can find its source code [here](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-voting-app-redis?WT.mc_id=github-azuredevtips-azureappsdev). 

We'll start by installing the [Bridge to Kubernetes extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mindaro.mindaro&WT.mc_id=microsoft-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) in VS Code.

1. Open VS Code and open the folder with the [source code of the sample application](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-voting-app-redis?WT.mc_id=github-azuredevtips-azureappsdev)
2. Click on the **Extensions** menu
3. Search for **"Bridge to Kubernetes"**. Select the result and click **Install**

4. You might see messages in VS Code that tell you to install dependencies like the YAML extension and Kubectl. Install the dependencies that it asks for
5. Assuming that you didn't connect your local development environment to AKS yet, VS Code will prompt you to **"Set the current cluster and name"**. Click on the message, which will take you to the Kubernetes menu
   1. In the **Clouds** section of the Kubernetes menu, you'll see Azure. When you sign into your Azure account, you will see your AKS cluster. Right-click on it and select **"Merge into Kubeconfig"**. Your local environment can now connect to the AKS cluster
6. In VS Code, click the **View** menu and **Command Palette**
7. In the Command Palette, type Bridge to Kubernetes and select **"Bridge to Kubernetes: Configure"** to set it up

(Configure Bridge to Kubernetes in VS Code)

8. Next, choose the **azure-vote-front** service to redirect to your machine. This is the frontend of the sample application

(Redirect traffic from the frontend to your local machine)

9.  Enter a local port to redirect the traffic to, like **80**
10. And next, click **"+ Create a new launch configuration"**
    1.  Select **Python**
    2.  And select **"Python file Debug the current active Python file"**. This creates a launch.json file, which you need for debugging in VS Code
    3.  Finally, pick **No** for the question **"Isolate your local version of azure-vote-front from other developers?"**. This will redirect all the traffic for the frontend to your local machine which is okay, as you are the only developer working on it right now

That's it! Let's start debugging the app. 

1. In the sample app in VS Code, open the azure-vote folder and open the **main.py** file
2. Now click on the **Run and Debug** menu on the left

(Debug in VS Code)

3. Click on the Run and Debug configuration **"Python: Current File with Kubernetes"**. This will start debugging. As you are using Bridge to Kubernetes, all traffic that flows to the frontend will be redirected to your local machine. This will open a browser with the frontend running in it

<img :src="$withBase('/files/149votingapp.png')">

(The sample app, redirected to the local machine)

4. In main.py, **set a breakpoint** at line 77 "vote = request.form['vote']"
5. In the browser, click one of the voting buttons. This should trigger the breakpoint and allow you to debug the application, which is still running in the AKS cluster

#### Conclusion
[Bridge to Kubernetes](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/bridge/overview-bridge-to-kubernetes?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) makes it easy to debug code that runs in a Kubernetes cluster. It is easy to use with the [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mindaro.mindaro&WT.mc_id=microsoft-azuredevtips-azureappsdev). You can use it alone or [with a team of developers](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/bridge/overview-bridge-to-kubernetes#using-routing-capabilities-for-developing-in-isolation?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) and [configure it](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/bridge/configure-bridge-to-kubernetes?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) when needed.
