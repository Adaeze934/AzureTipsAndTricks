### How to use Azure Service Bus Queues

#### Use Azure Service Bus Queues to decouple applications
Modern applications are made up of many components and services. For instance, you might have a web application that users use to order items from a shop. The web application uses an API that runs in an [Azure Function](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) to process the order. This works well, until the Azure Function is offline. To make sure that your application stays available, and that the web application and backend APIs can scale independently, you can decouple them with a queue. [Azure Service Bus Queues](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-queues-topics-subscriptions?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev#queues) provides a queue that helps with this.

The sending application (i.e. the web application), puts a message on the Azure Service Bus Queue. The backend API (i.e. the Azure Function), reads the message from the queue and processes the order for the web shop. You can use Azure Service Bus Queues as a simple decoupling mechanism, and use advanced features, like [first-in, first-out (FIFO) guarantee](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-bus-messaging/message-sessions?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev), [chaining Service Bus entities with autoforwarding](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-auto-forwarding?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev), or [Scheduled messages](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-bus-messaging/message-sequencing#scheduled-messages?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev).

In this post, we'll explore Azure Service Bus Queues by creating and using one in the Azure portal.

#### Prerequisites
If you want to follow along, you'll need the following:
* An Azure subscription (If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) before you begin)

#### Creating and using an Azure Service Bus Queue in the Azure portal
Let's create an Azure Service Bus. We'll use the Service Bus Explorer in the Azure portal to send messages to the queue.

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-azureappsdev)
2. Click the **Create a resource** button (the plus-sign in the top left corner) 
3. Search for **service bus**, select the "Service Bus" result and click **Create**
   1. This brings you to the **Create namespace** blade
   2. Select a **Resource Group**
   3. Fill in a **Name** for the service bus namespace
   4. Pick a **Location**
   5. Select a **Pricing Tier**. The Basic tier is fine for this demo
   6. Click **Review + create** and **Create** after that

(Create an Azure Service Bus Namespace in the Azure portal)

When the Service Bus Namespace is created, navigate to it in the Azure portal.

1. In the Service Bus Namespace in the Azure portal, select the **+ Queue** button in the top menu of the overview blade

2. Fill in the **Create queue** blade
   1. Fill in a **Name** for the queue
   2. Leave everything else as it is. Notice the settings for the advanced features like session, partitioning and forwarding
   3. Click **Create** to create the queue

3. Click on the queue to open it
4. Select the **Service Bus Explorer menu item**
5. First, we'll send a message to the queue
   1. Select **Text/Plain** for the **Content Type**. Messages for Azure Service Bus can also contain XML or Json content
   2. Type a text message in the text field
   3. Select **Expand Advanced Properties**. This allows you to edit advanced properties, like Label and Message ID. You can use these in your application to track or filter messages
   4. Type a value in the **Label** property
   5. Click **Send** to put the message on the queue

(Send message to the Service Bus Queue)

6. Scroll up to the menu of the Service Bus Explorer
7. Messages in the Service Bus Queue will stay there until they are deleted or expire. You can use the **Peek** function to take a look at a queue message, without deleting it. Click on the **Peek** menu
8. You'll see that there is 1 message on the queue. Click **Peek**
9. Select the message to see its details
10. Select the **Receive menu**
11. The message is still on the queue. Click **Receive** to perform a **ReceiveAndDelete** action, which reads the message and deletes it from the queue
12. Select the message to read its content. You'll also see the value of the **Label property** that you have set when you sent the message

#### Conclusion
You can use [Azure Service Bus Queues](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-queues-topics-subscriptions?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev#queues) to decouple parts of your solution and make them more available and scalable. Azure Service Bus Queues also provides advanced features like [first-in, first-out (FIFO) guarantee](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-bus-messaging/message-sessions?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev), [chaining Service Bus entities with autoforwarding](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-auto-forwarding?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev), and [Scheduled messages](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-bus-messaging/message-sequencing#scheduled-messages?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev).
