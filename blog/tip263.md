#### Enabling developers to work remotely

Working remotely has never been so approachable as it is today with tools and services enabling developers to collaborate, code, and ship from anywhere and any device. Recently I had a great opportunity to invite to my [twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/mbcrump?WT.mc_id=other-azuredevtips-micrum) channel and stream on remote development with Jonathan Carter, a principal group program manager at Microsoft. Jonathan and his team are working on some of the best in class tools enabling developers to stay productive while working remotely.

Enjoy these snippets of my stream with Jonathan covering five essential Visual Studio Code extensions and tools for remote work.
 
Create a guided code tour for your codebase right inside of Visual Studio Code to ease the collaboration, contribution, and onboarding to a new project.
