### How to customize and pin charts to your Azure Dashboard

#### See how your services are doing
When you work with Azure, it's useful to see information about your services, like availability, number of failed requests and server response time. Most resources in Azure produce this information, which you can visualize in charts within the service, or within overarching services like [Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/overview?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev). And you can also pin charts to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) [Dashboards](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-portal/azure-portal-dashboards?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) and customize them. This enables you to instantly see how your services are doing, and act on that information, if needed.

In this post, we'll pin charts to a [dashboard](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-portal/azure-portal-dashboards?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-azureappsdev), and customize them. 

#### Prerequisites
If you want to follow along, you'll need the following:
* An Azure subscription (If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) before you begin)

#### Pin charts to dashboards in the Azure portal
Let's pin a chart to a dashboard in the Azure portal. 

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-azureappsdev)
2. It could be that your Azure portal is configured to show **Home**. If so, click on the menu in the top-left and select **Dashboard**
3. In the dashboard, click on the **Edit** button. This puts the dashboard in customizing mode, and opens the **Tile Gallery**
4. Pick the **Metrics chart** tile and click **Add**
5. Click **"Edit in Metrics".** This opens the Azure Monitoring Metrics blade
6. A metrics chart is a general chart that can visualize any kind of metric for any Azure resource. To start, select a **scope** that contains the service(s) that you want to use for a chart. For instance, select an **Application Insights** resource
7. Next, pick a **Metric** to display. For instance, if you selected an Application Insights resource, pick **"Process IO rate"** as a metric
   1. You can now customize this chart by changing the time frame, chart type, adding filters or metrics and more
   2. When you are done customizing the chart, click **"Save to dashboard"**

(Pick a metric for the chart)

When the chart is saved to the dashboard, you can control it there. You can turn on **Auto refresh**. This reloads chart data every interval. For instance, every 5 minutes. You can also change the **Time settings** to see data for a different time frame and a different time granularity. These settings work for every chart that is pinned to the dashboard.

(Change dashboard time settings)

You can also configure individual chart settings directly from the dashboard. Click on the **...** button of the chart tile to open the tile settings menu and click **"Configure tile settings"**. You can now check **"Override the dashboard time settings at the tile level"** to change the time settings for this individual chart, without affecting other charts on the dashboards. If available, you can also override chart filters from here. This is a quick way to create the most useful dashboard for you.

#### Conclusion
Charts in Azure are essential to understand your Azure resources. And with [dashboards](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-portal/azure-portal-dashboards?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-azureappsdev), you can create a custom overview of the Azure information that matters to you.
