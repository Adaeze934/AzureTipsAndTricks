### How to use dependency injection in Azure Functions

#### Use dependency injection for code reuse and readability
When you are creating an application, you'll use different services and utilities throughout your classes. Some of these can have complex constructors, and some have dependencies on each other. By using [dependency injection](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/dependency-injection?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev), you make it easy for classes to receive an instance of a service and use it, without having to instantiate it. This makes your code more readable, and enables you to reuse services easier. 

You can use the dependency injection pattern in [Azure Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) that run on .NET. In this post, we'll see how that works.

#### Prerequisites
If you want to follow along, you'll need the following:
* An Azure subscription (If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) before you begin)
* The latest version of [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/?WT.mc_id=microsoft-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/?WT.mc_id=other-azuredevtips-azureappsdev)
  * Make sure to have the **Azure workload** enabled for Visual Studio 
  
#### Implement the dependency injection pattern in .NET Azure Functions
We'll start by creating an Azure Function with Visual Studio. You can also use VS Code for this if you prefer.

1. In Visual Studio, **create a new project**
2. Choose **Azure Functions** as the project template
3. Give the project a **Name**
4. Click **Create**
5. Next, select **Http trigger** and leave the rest of the settings as they are
6. Finally, click **Create** to create the project

(Create an Azure Functions project in Visual Studio)

To demonstrate the use of dependency injection, we'll add some files to the Azure Functions project. These contain an interface, a service that implements that interface, and a Startup class that configures dependency injection. 

1. Create a new file called **ITipsService.cs** and paste the code below into it

```
    public interface ITipService
    {
        string GetTip();
    }
```
2. Next, create a file called **TipService.cs**. Paste the following code into the file. This implements the **ITipService**. The **GetTip** method returns an [Azure Tips and Tricks URL](https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTipsAndTricks/?WT.mc_id=microsoft-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) for a random tip. 

```
    public class TipService : ITipService
    {
        public string GetTip()
        {
            Random tipNumber = new Random();

            return "https://microsoft.github.io/AzureTipsAndTricks/blog/tip" + tipNumber.Next(1, 335) + ".html";
        }
    }
```
3. Finally, create a file and name it **Startup.cs**. Paste the following code in it, and make sure that you change references to the namespace "FunctionApp1" to the namespace of your Function App. This code adds the HttpClient service to the app, and the TipsService. By declaring them here, we can use them with dependency injection throughout the rest of the application. Note that the Function App can only contain one class that inherits from **FunctionsStartup**. 

```
using Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;

[assembly: FunctionsStartup(typeof(FunctionApp1.Startup))]

namespace FunctionApp1
{
    public class Startup : FunctionsStartup
    {
        public override void Configure(IFunctionsHostBuilder builder)
        {
            builder.Services.AddHttpClient();

            builder.Services.AddSingleton<ITipService>((s) => {
                return new TipService();
            });
        }
    }
}
```
The project should now look something like this:

<img :src="$withBase('/files/135functionapp.png')">

(The Azure Function project in Visual Studio)

4. The startup class contains types from NuGet packages that you need to install. Right-click the project file and click **Manage NuGet packages**
5. Click **Browse**
6. Search for **Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Extensions** and install it
7. Do the same for **Microsoft.Extensions.Http**
8. Next, go to the **Function class** and change it into the code below:

```
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs;
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Http;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
using System.Net.Http;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace FunctionApp1
{
    public class Function1
    {
        private readonly HttpClient _client;
        private readonly ITipService _service;

        public Function1(IHttpClientFactory httpClientFactory, ITipService service)
        {
            this._client = httpClientFactory.CreateClient();
            this._service = service;
        }

        [FunctionName("Function1")]
        public async Task<IActionResult> Run(
            [HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Function, "get", "post", Route = null)] HttpRequest req,
            ILogger log)
        {
            var url = _service.GetTip();
            var response = await _client.GetAsync(url);

            if (response.StatusCode == System.Net.HttpStatusCode.OK)
            {
                return new RedirectResult(url);
            }
            else
            {
                return new NotFoundResult();
            }
        }
    }
}
```
This code uses a constructor to get an **IHttpClientFactory** and an **ITipService** injected into it. These are fully instantiated and ready to be used. That's the beauty of dependency injection. Next, it uses the **TipService.GetTip** method to retrieve the URL of an Azure Tips and Tricks post. It then uses the **HttpClient** to retrieve the website of the URL. If it exists, it will send a redirect request to that website, which sends the browser to the Azure Tips and Tricks post.

9. **Run** the Function
10. When the Function is running, it shows you the **Function URL** that you can use to trigger it. Copy the URL and **paste in it a browser**
11. You'll be redirected to a post on the Azure Tips and Tricks website

#### Conclusion
[Dependency injection](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/dependency-injection?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) is a software development pattern that makes code easier to read and reuse. You can use it in .NET [Azure Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) by implementing a Startup class that uses the **FunctionsStartup class** to function.
