### How to get started with Azure DevTest Labs

#### Reusable lab environments for testing and training
[Azure DevTest Labs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devtest-labs/devtest-lab-overview?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) helps you quickly create environments in Azure while minimizing waste and controlling cost. You can test the latest version of your application by quickly provisioning environments using reusable templates and artifacts like [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/?WT.mc_id=microsoft-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/?WT.mc_id=other-azuredevtips-azureappsdev), and easily [integrate it with your DevOps pipeline](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devtest-labs/devtest-lab-dev-ops?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev), or create pre-provisioned environments for training and demos. 

In this post, we'll spin up and explore an [Azure DevTest Lab](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devtest-labs/devtest-lab-overview?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev).

#### Prerequisites
If you want to follow along, you'll need the following:
* An Azure subscription (If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) before you begin)

#### Create a pool of claimable Virtual Machines (VMs) with all your favorite tools preinstalled 
We'll create a small DevTest Lab environment that we can use for software development. Let's start by creating the DevTest Lab resource in Azure:

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-azureappsdev)
2. Click the **Create a resource** button (the plus-sign in the top left corner) 
3. Search for **DevTest**, select the "DevTest Labs" result and click **Create**
   1. Select a **Resource group**
   2. Type in a **Lab name**
   3. Select a **Location** for the lab
   4. Leave the **Public environments** setting to **On**

(Create a DevTest Lab in the Azure portal)

   5. Click **Next: Auto-shutdown**
   6. Select **On** for the **Enabled** setting. This will enable auto-shutdown for all VMs that you create in the lab
   7. Fill in the **Scheduled shutdown** time
   8. Pick the correct **Time zone**
   9. Click **Review + create** and then **Create** to create the lab

(Configure DevTest Lab default auto-shutdown settings)

When the DevTest Lab is created, navigate to it in the Azure portal. From the overview, we can create an environment of VMs. We'll keep it simple and create single VMs for the lab users to claim. You can also use [Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates](https://github.com/Azure/azure-devtestlab/tree/master/samples/DevTestLabs/QuickStartTemplates?WT.mc_id=github-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) to create more complex lab environments, with multiple VMs. 

1. In the overview blade of the DevTest Lab, click **Add** to start creating a VM
2. You can now pick a base for your environment. Search for **"Visual Studio"** and click on one of the results that contains Visual Studio. This creates a VM that has Visual Studio preinstalled on it
3. In the next blade, configure the settings for the lab resource
   1. Fill in a **Name** for the VM
   2. Provide a **Username**
   3. Also fill in a **Password**, or use a saved secret for the password
   4. Check the **Save as default password** box
   5. You can leave the **Disk and Size** for the VM as it is, or change it if you'd like
   6. Leave the **OS disk type** to the default setting
   7. Click on **Add or Remove Artifacts**. This is one of the best features of DevTest Labs. In the [Add artifacts blade](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devtest-labs/add-artifact-vm?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev), you can pick software that will be preinstalled on all VMs in your lab. There are lots of standard software items that you can choose from the [public DevTest Labs Git repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-devtestlab/tree/master/Artifacts?WT.mc_id=github-azuredevtips-azureappsdev). And you can add artifacts from your own Git repository
      1. Search for **Notepad++**
      2. Click in the **arrow next to the result**
      3. Select **OK** to add the artifact
      4. Click **OK** to go back to the previous blade

<img :src="$withBase('/files/126artifacts.png')">

(Add artifacts to the VM)

   8. Next, click on the **Advanced Settings** tab
   9. Set **Make this machine claimable** to **Yes**. This will enable lab users to claim the VM, so that they can use it exclusively
   10. Change **Number of instances** to **3**
   11. Go back to the **Basic Settings** tab
   12. click **Create** to create the lab with 3 VMs

When the VMs are created, you can find them in the **Claimable virtual machines** menu of the DevTest Lab resource. Click on one of the VMs to see its details. You'll see that it has the auto-shutdown feature enabled by default.

1. Click **Claim machine** to claim the VM. This means that the VM is now yours to use, until you unclaim it
2. Navigate to the **Create formula** menu. Here, you can create a reusable base from this VM, including its artifacts. This is useful when you want to create more VMs based on this one
3. Next, click on the **Artifacts** menu. This shows you the artifacts that you configured earlier, and shows when they were installed
4. Go back to the overview blade of the VM and click **Connect**. This downloads an RDP file
5. Open the RDP file and fill in the **username** and **password** for the VM
6. In the VM, search for **Notepad++**. You'll see that it is preinstalled on the machine

(Notepad++ is a preinstalled artifact on the VM)

#### Conclusion
Azure DevTest Labs is great for quickly spinning up customized VM environments that your team can use for development, testing and training. And with intelligent features like [auto-shutdown](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devtest-labs/devtest-lab-auto-shutdown?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev), [policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devtest-labs/devtest-lab-set-lab-policy?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev), and [integration with Azure DevOps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devtest-labs/devtest-lab-dev-ops?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev), administrators have control over costs, security and customization. Go and check it out!
