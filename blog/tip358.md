### How to configure Azure Application Insights for a Web App in Visual Studio

#### Monitor your application with Application Insights
[Azure Application insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) is part of [Azure Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/overview?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev). You can use it to monitor individual applications, e.g., web applications, and track data including users, page events, errors and calls to dependencies, e.g., databases and APIs. 

In this post, we'll use [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/?WT.mc_id=microsoft-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) to enable [Azure Application Insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) for an application. 

#### Prerequisites
If you want to follow along, you'll need the following:
* An Azure subscription (If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) before you begin)
* The latest version of [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/?WT.mc_id=microsoft-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) with the **"ASP NET and web development"** and **"Azure Development"** workloads enabled

#### Use Visual Studio for Application Insights
We can use Visual Studio to configure Application Insights to work with a web application. Let's try it out.

1. Open Visual Studio
2. Choose **Create a new project** on the splash screen, or through the menu (File > New > Project)
3. Select **ASP NET Core Web App** and click **Next**
4. Enter a **Name** for the project
5. Pick a **Location**
6. Click **Next**
7. Leave the rest of the settings as they are and click **Create**
8. In the Solution Explorer, **right-click** the project and select **"Configure Application Insights..."**

9. You can use the Application Insights SDK without connecting to an Azure instance of Application Insights. We are not going to do that, so select **Azure Application Insights** and click **Next**
10. In the next screen, click the **+ button** to create a new Application Insights resource in Azure
    1.  Enter a **Name**
    2.  Select a **Resource Group**
    3.  Pick a **Location**
    4.  Click **Create** to create the Application Insights resource

11. Click **Next** to use the Application Insights resource that we've just created
12. Leave the connection string settings as they are and click **Next**
13. In the **Summary** screen, you can see what Visual Studio will do to configure Application Insights. Click **Finish** to let Visual Studio configure it

When the configuration is complete, we can test it. Press **F5** to start debugging the application and click on the links in the web app. In the **Projects** menu of Visual Studio, you can now select Application Insights, which will show all the data that it collected.

And when you navigate to the Application Insights instance in the Azure portal, you can drill down into all the data, e.g. the page events.
