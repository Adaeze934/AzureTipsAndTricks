### How to use Azure Defender to protect hybrid cloud workloads

#### A central place for security
[Azure Security Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/security-center-introduction?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) provides actionable security insights for all your Azure and non-Azure resources. It gives you an overall security score, and detects misconfiguration in resources, like open network ports, and more. Security Center is free to all Azure users. 
And in Azure Security Center, you can enable the [Azure Defender feature](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/azure-defender?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev), which is a paid feature. Azure Defender provides advanced, intelligent protection of your Azure and hybrid resources. It lets you implement custom security policies and regulatory standards, like [NIST](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework?WT.mc_id=other-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) and [Azure CIS](https://www.cisecurity.org/blog/cis-microsoft-azure-foundations-benchmark-v1-0-0-now-available/?WT.mc_id=other-azuredevtips-azureappsdev), so that you can make sure that your resources comply to them, and what's needed to get them there. And it has a lot more advanced threat detection capabilities.

[Azure Defender](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/azure-defender?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) can defend resources in Azure, and also outside of Azure, like on-premises or in other clouds. In this post, we'll take a look at using Azure Defender to monitor my local, non-Azure machine.

#### Prerequisites
If you want to follow along, you'll need the following:
* An Azure subscription (If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) before you begin)
* A local machine to install the [Log Analytics Agent](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/agents/log-analytics-agent?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) on

#### Onboard non-Azure servers to Azure Defender
Let's get started by looking at Azure Security Center and onboarding my local machine. There are several ways to onboard a non-Azure resource to Azure Defender, including [onboarding it to Azure Arc](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/quickstart-onboard-machines?pivots=azure-arc&WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev#add-non-azure-machines-with-azure-arc), and using the [AWS](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/quickstart-onboard-aws?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) and [GCP](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/quickstart-onboard-gcp?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) cloud connectors. We'll connect my local machine to a [Log Analytics workspace](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-overview?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) that has Azure Defender enabled. 

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-azureappsdev)
2. Open the **Azure Security Center**
3. Navigate to the **Inventory** menu. This shows all the resources that Security Center is monitoring. From here, you'll get an overview of the health of your resources, and which ones aren't being monitored

4. Let's add my machine. Click on the **Add non-Azure servers** button. This takes you to the **Onboard servers to Security Center** blade. From here, you can connect servers to an Azure Log Analytics workspace, which connects with Security Center
5. Click **Create New Workspace**
   1. Select a **Resource group** for the workspace
   2. Fill in a **Name**
   3. Pick a **Region**
   4. Select **Review + Create** and then **Create**

6. When the Log Analytics workspace is created, it shows in the **Onboard servers to Security Center** blade. Click the **Upgrade** button to make sure that Azure Defender is activated for the workspace
7. Next, click the **Add Servers** button of the workspace
8. Now we can download a Log Analytics Agent for Windows or Linux and install it. I have a Windows machine, so I click **Download Windows Agent (64 bit)**. Download the one that works for your Operating System
9. Open the downloaded file and go through the wizard
   1.  On the welcome screen, click **Next**
   2.  Read the License Terms and click **I Agree**
   3.  Optionally select a location for the installation and click **Next**
   4.  Check the **Connect the agent to Azure Log Analytics (OMS)** box and click **Next**
   5.  Now fill in the **Workspace ID** and **Workspace Key** that you'll find in the **Agents management blade** of the Azure portal, and click **Next**
   6.  Click **Next** again
   7.  Finally, click **Install** to install the agent

Your machine will show in the Azure Security Center when ready and be protected by Azure Defender. From there, you can drill down into and respond to any security recommendations.

#### Conclusion
[Azure Defender](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/azure-defender?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) is an advanced feature of [Azure Security Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security-center/security-center-introduction?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev). It provides intelligent security monitoring and detection capabilities for resources in Azure, on-premises and in other clouds. Go and check it out!
