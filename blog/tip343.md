### How to get started with Azure Arc - Part 1

#### Extend Azure to any computer
Hybrid computing is here to stay. Almost every company has on-premises resources, or computers in other clouds that they need to manage. [Azure Arc](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-arc/overview?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) makes this easy by making any computer part of Azure, no matter where it runs. This enables you to onboard computers to Azure Arc and manage their security, updates, configuration, health, and more.

This post is the first of a series of three. This first post will explore Azure [Arc-enabled servers](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-arc/servers/overview?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev), by connecting a computer to Azure Arc.

#### Prerequisites
If you want to follow along, you'll need the following:
* An Azure subscription (If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) before you begin)
* A computer that you can connect to Azure Arc. This can be your local computer, or a computer in a cloud

#### Onboard a computer to Azure Arc
I will onboard my local Windows computer to Azure Arc. This involves opening network ports, and running a script to download, install, and configure a local agent. First, we'll generate the onboarding script:

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-azureappsdev)
2. Click the **Create a resource** button (the plus-sign in the top left corner) 
3. Search for **arc**, select the "Servers - Azure Arc" result and click **Create**
4. In the next screen, select **Generate script** on the **Add a single server** option

(Choose "Add a single server")

5. Review the requirements and click **Next: Resource details**
6. In the Resource details blade:
   1. Select a **Resource Group** 
   2. Pick **East US** for the **region** of the server
   3. Leave the **Operating system** to **Windows**   
   4. Set the **Connectivity method** to **Public endpoint** 
   5. Click **Next:Tags**

(Configure the Azure Arc resource details)

7. Click **Next: Download and run script**
8. Copy the script

Go to the computer that you want to onboard to Azure Arc.

1. Make sure that the computer adheres to all the [requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-arc/servers/agent-overview#prerequisites?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) that the Azure Arc agent needs
2. Open an **elevated PowerShell prompt**
3. Run the **script**
4. The script will prompt you to open a browser and log in to Azure. When that is done, and the script continues successfully, the computer has been onboarded

(Run the script in PowerShell)

That's it! The computer is now part of Azure, and you can manage it through Azure Arc.

1. Go to the Azure portal
2. Search for **Azure Arc**, and open it. This opens the Azure Arc overview
3. Click on the **All Azure Arc Resources menu**, or the **Servers** menu, to see the computer
4. Select the onboarded computer to see what you can do with it from Azure Arc

(Security recommendations for the Azure Arc-enabled computer)

You can now manage the computer through Azure Arc. It will show you security recommendations for the machine, and you can manage updates and configurations for it, once you've set that up using [Azure Automation](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/automation/?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-azureappsdev). You can also create policies to govern the computer, and monitor its performance and health. 

#### Conclusion
[Azure Arc](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-arc/overview?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) extends Azure to wherever your machines are. Once a machine is [Arc-enabled](https://docs.microsoft.comazure/azure-arc/servers/overview?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev), it becomes part of Azure, and can be managed just like any VM in Azure. Go and check it out!
