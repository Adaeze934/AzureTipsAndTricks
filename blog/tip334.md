### How to copy data from one Cosmos DB container to another container

#### Cosmos DB data migration
Sometimes, you need to migrate data from one [Azure Cosmos DB](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/introduction?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) to another. You can, for instance, do this if you need to change the partition key of a container, or to consolidate Cosmos DB instances. 

The [Cosmos DB live data migrator tool](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-cosmosdb-live-data-migrator?WT.mc_id=github-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) enables you to migrate data from one container to another. In this post, we'll configure the tool to try it out.

#### Prerequisites
If you want to follow along, you'll need the following:
* An Azure subscription (If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) before you begin)
* Two [Azure Cosmos DB](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/create-cosmosdb-resources-portal?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) instances with databases and containers. One of the containers should contain data that can be migrated.

#### Use the Cosmos DB live data migrator tool
Let's try it out. To use the migration tool, we first need to create an application registration.

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-azureappsdev)
2. Search for **"app registrations"**, and click on the **App registration** result
3. Click **New registration** to start registering the migration tool app
   1. Type in a **Name** for the application. For instance **"tips01"**. 
   2. Put in a **Redirect URI*. This should contain the name, so something like **"https://tips01-ui.azurewebsites.net/signin-oidc"**
   3. Click **Register**

    (Create an App Registration in the Azure portal)

   4. Next, note the **Application (client) ID** in the overview blade of the App registration. **Copy it** to use it later
   5. Navigate to the **Authentication** menu
   6. Fill in a **Front-channel logout URL**. Again, this should contain the name, like **"https://tips01-ui.azurewebsites.net/signout-callback-oidc"**
   7. Check **ID tokens (used for implicit and hybrid flows)**
   8. Click **Save**
   9. Next, go to the **Manifest** menu
   10. Add to the **requiredResourceAccess** node, so that it looks like this:

```
	"requiredResourceAccess": [
		{
			"resourceAppId": "00000003-0000-0000-c000-000000000000",
			"resourceAccess": [
				{
					"id": "e1fe6dd8-ba31-4d61-89e7-88639da4683d",
					"type": "Scope"
				},
				{
					"id": "b340eb25-3456-403f-be2f-af7a0d370277",
					"type": "Scope"
				}
			]
		}
	],
```
   11.   Click **Save**

(Change the manifest of the App registration)

   1.  In the manifest, copy the **publisherDomain** for later

Now that we have an application registration, we can deploy the migration app.

1. Go to [this link](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure-Samples%2Fazure-cosmosdb-live-data-migrator%2Fmaster%2FMigration.ResourceGroup%2FMigrationServices.json?WT.mc_id=github-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) to start creating the migration app
   1. First, select a **Resource Group**
   2. Next, type in a **Resource Name Prefix**. This should be the name that you used earlier. So, in my case, it is **"tips01"**
   3. In **Default Source Database Account Name**, put in a name for the Cosmos DB connection that will serve as the migration source. This can be anything, and you can change it later
   4. For **Default Source Database Account Connection String**, type in the connection string for the source Cosmos DB. You can find this in the Azure portal
   5. Type a name for the **Default Destination Database Account Name**
   6. Provide the connection string for the destination Cosmos DB account in **Default Destination Database Account Connection String**
   7. In the **Allowed Users field**, provide a user that will use the migration tool. This can be an objectId or email address of a user that is in the same tenant where the application will be deployed. You can provide multiple users by separating them with the "|" character
   8. Next, provide the **publisher domain** from the App Registration Manifest in the **Aad App Registration Publisher Domain field**
   9. Finally, in the **Aad App Registration Client ID field**, put in the **Application (client) ID** from the App registration
   10. Click **Review + create** and then **Create** to deploy the migration tool

    <img :src="$withBase('/files/118register3.png')">

    (Deploy the migration tool)

The migration tool will deploy several resources. This includes an [Azure App Service Web App](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/web/?WT.mc_id=azure-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) that runs the UI for the tool. Find the Web App in the Azure portal and open the UI in a browser. The URL will use the name that you provided earlier. So, in my case, it is https://tips01-ui.azurewebsites.net

1. To start creating a migration, click **Create**
2. Now fill in the source and destination details
   1. For source and destination, provide the **Cosmos DB database name** in the **DB** field
   2. Fill in the database **Container** name
   3. Provide the **Partition key** for the source and destination
   4. Click **Create / Start**

    (Create a new migration)

3. You can watch the progress of any open migrations by clicking on the **List** menu and refreshing your browser
4. When all documents are migrated, click **Complete** to mark the migration as finished

(Complete the migration)

#### Conclusion
Migrating data between [Azure Cosmos DB](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/introduction?WT.mc_id=docs-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) containers can be difficult. The [Cosmos DB live data migrator tool](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-cosmosdb-live-data-migrator?WT.mc_id=github-azuredevtips-azureappsdev) helps to create and manage migrations. Go and check it out!
